Just a tool to get financial data and display it somehow, probably using tui. So far after the first broadcast it uses crossterm to get keyboard input and has one method to make blocking requests via reqwest through FinnHub's free API.

Todo: 

- Remove strum (fun to do but total overkill)
- Move API choices from top of block 1 to table: use all arrow keys to choose
- Find company automatically instead of having to remember symbol and moving to company profile to manually type in

API stuff todo:
